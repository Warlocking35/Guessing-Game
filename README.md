# Guessing-Game
This is a simple guessing game. Choose whether you want to play or not, and then guess a number between 1 and 100.

If the file closes out right after you have inputed a number that means you have guessed it right.

If the file closes out right when you type no at the beginning of the game, then you have decided not to play the game.
